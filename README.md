# Constitutive Modeling of Bulk Metallic Glasses using Atomistic Simulation
This repository contains the code that was used to study metallic glasses by simulating Shear Transformation Zones (STZs) using atomistic simulations. The complete workflow contains five independent subsections, that act on the input Bulk Metallic Glass (BMG) system in succession to generate the output parameters ( STZ size at yield, Activation Volume, Mohr-Coloumb parameter). The complete workflow can be graphically abstracted as below.
